This web application allows users to schedule space launch missions to habitable planets using data sourced from the NASA archive.

The project encompasses three key tabs, each serving a distinct purpose to enhance the user experience. The "Schedule Launch" tab empowers users to plan and schedule new space launch missions, selecting their desired habitable planet as the destination. Leveraging the extensive information available from the NASA archive, users can explore various habitable planets and make informed decisions when planning their missions.

In the "Upcoming" tab, users gain access to a comprehensive overview of all scheduled space launches that will take place in the future. This tab not only provides users with a glimpse into the exciting upcoming missions but also offers the functionality to abort scheduled launches if necessary. By integrating this feature, SpaceLaunch Scheduler ensures flexibility and adaptability in users' mission planning process.

The "History" tab serves as a repository of vital information regarding the project's past space launches. Users can review and analyze the missions that have already been launched, as well as view details about any aborted launch missions. This historical perspective provides a valuable reference point for users, allowing them to reflect on past missions and learn from the outcomes.
